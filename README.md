# 🖥️ THA078BCT021_lab
This repository contains solutions for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab assignments of the 3rd semester in Computer Engineering at the Institute of Engineering (IOE), Tribhuvan University.

# ⚠️ WARNING 
Copy-pasting is fine, but without understanding the fundamentals, it's bad programming practice. I'd suggest looking through the code where you face trouble and refer to my solutions. Also, this code was part of my 3rd-semester lab; it might differ if the curriculum is updated.

# 📋 Overview
In this repository, you'll find solutions implemented in C++ for various lab assignments related to OOP concepts. Each assignment is organized into separate files, providing clear instructions and code solutions. Lab 1 and 2 are missing as they are relatively simple; try solving them yourself.

# 🚀 Usage 
Feel free to explore each assignment folder to understand the problem statement and review the code solutions. You can clone this repository to your local machine using:



git clone https://github.com/Kshitiz726/THA078BCT021_lab.git
